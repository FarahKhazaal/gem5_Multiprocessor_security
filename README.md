# System-Level Design for Assessing Shared Resources Effects on Multiprocessor Systems Security using GEM5

Welcome to the project repository for "System-Level Design for Assessing Shared Resources Effects on Multiprocessor Systems Security." This repository contains the resources and documentation related to the study of processor architecture vulnerabilities using the gem5 software.

## Project Description

This project aims to explore the capabilities of the gem5 software for analyzing vulnerabilities in processor architectures. The focus is on understanding the impact of shared resources on the security of multiprocessor systems. The project underscores the significance of hardware security in the development of embedded systems and advocates for the integration of safety considerations from the early stages of design.

## Features

    1- Study the vulnerabilities and security concerns related to multiprocessor systems.
    2- Utilize gem5, a powerful simulation tool, for assessing the impact of shared resources on system security.
    3- Explore hardware security in embedded systems and the importance of considering safety constraints during the design process.
